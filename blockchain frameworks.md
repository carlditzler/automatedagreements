# Distributed ledgers or [blockchain frameworks](https://www.igvita.com/2014/05/05/minimum-viable-block-chain/) supporting smart contracts:

1. [Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) - Consensus by Proof of Work; will change to Proof of Stake
2. [Hyperledger Fabric](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric)
3. [R3 Corda](https://github.com/corda/corda) - Pluggable consensus
4. [Chain](https://github.com/chain/chain) - Based on bitcoin's blockchain code 
5. [Quorum, JPMorgan](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum) - Based on Ethereum and introducing encrypted P2P messaging. Majority voting, Raft-based or Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance like consensus
6. [Hyperledger Sawtooth](https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core) - Consensus based on Proof of Elapsed Time
