# Distributed ledgers or [blockchain frameworks](https://www.igvita.com/2014/05/05/minimum-viable-block-chain/) supporting smart contracts:

1. [Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) - Decentralized application platform with consensus by Proof of Work; will change to Proof of Stake
2. [Hyperledger Fabric](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric - Pluggable, private and permissioned network requiring enrollment via a Membership Service Provider (MSP)
3. [R3 Corda](https://github.com/corda/corda) - Pluggable consensus with a semi-private network, enforces rules that nodes must provide and with a mandatory KYC process
4. [Chain](https://github.com/chain/chain) - Platform supporting multiple and independent secured blockchain networks written in Go. Enables issuance, ownership, and control of digital assets issued, transferred and exchanged by posting transactions to the Chain network
5. [Quorum, JPMorgan](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum) - Based on Ethereum and introducing encrypted P2P messaging. Majority voting, Raft-based or Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance like consensus
6. [Hyperledger Sawtooth](https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core) - Consensus based on Proof of Elapsed Time
