# Distributed ledgers or [blockchain frameworks](https://www.igvita.com/2014/05/05/minimum-viable-block-chain/) supporting smart contracts:

1. [Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) - Decentralized application platform with consensus by Proof of Work; will change to Proof of Stake

Preferred smart contract language: Solidity
2. [Hyperledger Fabric](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric) - Pluggable, private and permissioned network requiring enrollment via a Membership Service Provider (MSP)

Preferred smart contract language: Go
3. [R3 Corda](https://github.com/corda/corda) - Pluggable consensus with a semi-private network, enforces rules that nodes must provide and with a mandatory KYC process

Preferred smart contract language: Kotlin
4. [Chain](https://github.com/chain/chain) - Platform supporting multiple and independent secured blockchain networks written in Go. Enables issuance, ownership, and control of digital assets issued, transferred and exchanged by posting transactions to the Chain network

Preferred smart contract language: Ivy
5. [Quorum, JPMorgan](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum) - Based on Ethereum and introducing encrypted P2P messaging. Majority voting, Raft-based or Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance like consensus

Preferred smart contract language: Solidity
6. [Hyperledger Sawtooth](https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core) - Cryptographically verfiable DB (global state agreement to ensure nodes have identical copies) with parallel transaction execution for high throughput, and consensus based on Proof of Elapsed Time, Byzantine Fault Tolerant options. Can integrate with Ethereum

Preferred smart contract language: Python, Go or JavaScript; Solidity with Seth
