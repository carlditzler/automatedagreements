# Automated Agreements
[automatedagreements.com](http://www.automatedagreements.com)

*Automated Agreements* is a book in draft about designing and implementing smart contracts on blockchain networks.

Smart contracts could increase the sales of goods and services and expand global trade through improved automation, and transactional, legal and technical efficiencies. 
 
With the *Automated Agreements* book, youâ€™ll learn about smart contracts using blockchain technologies, and how to plan, design and implement smart contracts. Transactions can automatically complete or progress once there is a triggering event or performance without a middleman and the risk of a party not following through with a contractual obligation.

Understand use cases for smart contracts and best practices for smart contact implementation with *Automated Agreements*.
